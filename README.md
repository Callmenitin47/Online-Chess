# Online Chess

## Description

This project is a real-time, multiplayer chess game developed using Flask for the backend, Flask-SocketIO for real-time gameplay, MySQL for user authentication, and MongoDB for storing match history. The game ensures low-latency gameplay and provides a smooth user experience. The chessboard is dynamically updated in real-time as players make moves.
